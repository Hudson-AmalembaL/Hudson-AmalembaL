### Hi there, I'm Hudson! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about artificial intuition and its potential in programming and artificial intelligence, along with deepening my understanding of complex mathematical models that influence primary variables. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that blend programming with philosophical thought, especially those that tackle the intersection of technology, artificial intelligence, and game theory. Iâ€™m particularly keen on exploring how intuition and human-like decision-making can shape software development.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with designing advanced algorithms or discovering new approaches to integrating emergent rules in complex systems, especially in gaming or AI-driven scenarios.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software development practices, game design, Web3 applications, or even the philosophical questions surrounding artificial intuition and human existence. Iâ€™m always open to a deep discussion!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hudson-luseno-a53606175) or drop me an email at [amalembahudson@gmail.com]. Iâ€™d love to discuss ideas, collaborate, or just share thoughts on programming and the future of technology.
